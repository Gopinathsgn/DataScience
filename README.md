Social networks produce an enormous quantity of data. It became part of our daily lives and
established new communication structures and behaviours in society. The increasing popularity of
social media encourages more and more users to participate in various online activities and
produces data in an unprecedented rate. Recent advances in computer science provide necessary
computational tools and techniques for us to verify social theories on large-scale social media data.
Social media data is big, linked, noisy, highly unstructured and incomplete, and differs from data in
traditional data mining which cultivates a new research field - social media mining. So we are using
machine learning algorithms to extract knowledge or insights to discover the patterns from large
data.
